    <h3>3) What event bubbling and explain it?</h3>
    <p>Event bubbling is an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up and works viseversa that is called capturing.When you click the button, you can think of it like you're also clicking the span (the blue background). This is because the button is a child of the span. It's also the same thing with the div and the body. When you click the button, it's just like you're also clicking the span, div, and body because they are the button's ancestors. This is the idea of event bubbling. </p>

    <h3>4) What call back function and explain it?</h3>
    <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. We can say that a funtion parameter is another function.that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed.Asynchronous means that works is not serially.</p>
